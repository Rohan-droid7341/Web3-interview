# Overwhelm - Trading PlayGround 

Overwhelm is a decentralized trading dApp designed to help beginners step into the world of trading without the risks of losing real money. Using dummy tokens, users can learn the ins and outs of trading while still experiencing real-time market dynamics. With live price feeds for Ethereum (ETH) and USD tokens, users can practice trading just like in real markets. A built-in faucet lets them wrap their Sepolia ETH into WETH, forming the foundation for all trades inside the app.

This immersive and risk-free environment provides an ideal training ground for aspiring traders to hone their skills and build confidence before venturing into live markets.
